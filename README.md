# Purpose

I am creating this account as I delve into the world of programming. 
My two main goals are: Solve as many project eulers as possible; and become a world class lawyer with big pockets

IN my journey with project eulers I will create a website to discuss my solutions. 
I will also garner expertise in the area of mathematics 

A third, secondary goal is to create scripts that assist my day to day proceedings 



I am a power systems engineer - a second secondary goal of mine is to create scripts in matlab and python that help me with my current research project on the UST microgrid.
